# mdBook

## What
[mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) is a the defacto-standard for writing Rust books. It uses markdown-files and is very simple to use.

## Why
It is very easy to add and work with the files and it looks good enough. For Rust code examples it can run them directly and output the result which is nice for examples.

There are also many pre-processors and you can provide your own css-files if you need to make it prettier.

## How
This blog uses the default setup of `mdBook`, but I am tempted to find a use of [svgbob](https://ivanceras.github.io/svgbob-editor/) which has a pre-processor and is something I find very coolðŸ˜Š.
